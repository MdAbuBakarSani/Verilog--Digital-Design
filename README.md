# Verilog--Digital-Design

#📌 Overview (In Progress to build the repository)

Verilog HDL implementations of combinational and sequential circuits, including basic digital design modules and test examples. It covers all the Combinational and Sequential circuits. Each project includes RTL design, testbenches, and simulation results to demonstrate the complete design and verification flow.
